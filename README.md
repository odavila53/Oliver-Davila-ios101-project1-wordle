# Project 1 - *Wordle Project*

Submitted by: Oliver Davila

Wordle Project is an app that allows the user to guess a hidden word given a certain number of tries. First, the user will into a 5 letter word and the program will highlight any letters that are in the end word. If it is highlighted yellow, then the letter is in the word but it doesn't tell you where. If its green, then the user has correctly guessed the placement of the letter. Once the whole word turns green then the game is over.

Time spent: 3-4 hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This was my first time working with closures so I had a difficult time trying to understand the concept. When I first started creating it I didn't understand the 'in' statement of the closure but know I know its for the closure's parameters and return type to be executed first. The if-statement itself wasn't too difficult after creating a variable and setting it to itself then calling it in the if statement
